                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is <b>Kshitij</b>, and I am a <b>computer science</b> student at the <b>University of Texas at Dallas</b>. 
                    I find a lot of joy in creating and experiencing <b>experiences</b>. 
                    As someone would tell a story to readers or, in my case, craft an experience for my users.
                    When I'm not working on projects, you'll find me immersed in other passions. I love <b>cooking</b> and trying out new foods. 
                    The kitchen becomes my playground, where flavors dance and new recipes come to life. 
                    It's a symphony of tastes, each dish telling its own <b>story</b>.
                    I also love <b>leveling up</b> and going to the gym. Fitness isn't just a routine; it's a journey of self-improvement and resilience. 
                    I spend countless hours perfecting my form and pushing my limits, each workout designed with meticulous attention to detail.
                    <b>Every project, every meal, every workoutâ€”each one</b> is a testament to my <b>dedication and passion</b>. 
                    I believe in going the <b>extra step</b> to ensure everything I create is a <b>unique and memorable experience</b>.
                    <b>Stop by</b> and spend as much time as you would like! 
                    <b>Let's share</b> stories, savor new flavors, and immerse ourselves in the magic of technology, culinary arts, and fitness.
