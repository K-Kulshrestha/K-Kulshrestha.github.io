        <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Kshitij Kulshrestha and I am currently a third-year computer science student at The University of Texas at Dallas, 
        I have a passion for technology. 
        I'm constantly seeking opportunities to explore and acquire new skills in the tech industry.
        I have experience creating front-end interfaces as well as developing full-stack applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        When I was 8 years old, I was introduced to the world of computers and I was fascinated by the way they worked.
        I was always curious about how the computer was able to do so many things and how it was able to process so much information.
        I remember watching my dad and my sister playing games together on the computer and I was amazed by the fact that they were able to play games on the computer.
